     <h2>About Elim Garak</h2>
      <p>
      Elim Garak, an exiled Cardassian tailor living on aboard space station Deep Space 9 (Terok Nor).
      Garak considers his new life at Deep Space 9 intolerable and as a form of torture.
      The reason for his exiled is unknown, but it has something to do with his mentor Enabran Tain.
      While living in exile, he befriends Dr. Julian Bashir, the space station chief medical officer and Odo, the chief of security.
      Upon their first meeting, Bashir suspects Garak of being a spy, but he denies it.
      Both Odo and Garak share a mutual respect for one another and wish to return home.

      <h2>More on Garak...</h2>
          <blockquote cite ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elim_Garak">
    "Garak changes from a simple mysterious character to one of complexity and secrecy.
    Robinson stated that the complexity of Garak's character did not come from his lies but rather his refusal to elaborate on himself.
    The important thing about Garak is that he lives in the subtext. Again, with the iceberg analogy, the substance of Garak is what you don't hear.
    It's what he doesn't say."

        <p>"We're running out of options… You don't want to be vaporized because you need a body.

          <h2>DS9: "In The Pale Moonlight"</h2>
          <p> Garak explains his actions in assasinating a Romulan Senator and Grathon Tolar to Sisko.</p>
          <blockquote cite ="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Pale_Moonlight_(episode)">
            "That's why you came to me, isn't it Captain? Because you knew I could do those things that you weren't capable of doing.
             Well, it worked. And you'll get what you wanted: a war between the Romulans and the Dominion.
            And if your conscience is bothering you, you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved the entire Alpha Quadrant,
            and all it cost was the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal… and the self-respect of one Starfleet officer.
             I don't know about you, but I'd call that a bargain."<span>  -- Elim Garak</span>
